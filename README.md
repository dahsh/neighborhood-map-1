# My Favorite Places - Web Application

This is an asynchronous web application featuring a map with buttons (choices) to choose between Hong Kong or San Francisco. Depending on which list is chosen, a list of my favorite locations as well as map markers will be shown. The reason I built this web application is for my nomad friends who frequently visit the met areas of Hong Kong and/or San Francisco and often ask what to do, where to go, and what to eat. These lists of locations include some of the places I used to hang out when I lived there. In short, if you are visiting Hong Kong or San Francisco, you should check out these places. I am sure you will love them!

## Project's Goals
1. Include a list view of my favorite locations
2. Use Google Maps API and show the list of locations as Map Markers
3. Include a search bar with filter functionality to show filtered map markers and locations list
4. Use foursquare API to display data inside infoWindow when use clicks on map markers
5. Clicking on locations list will trigger animation and action at selected map marker, which will show data in infowindow (name, category, location, and foursquare link to venue for more info)
6. All data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner
7. Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures
8. Run web application error free

## Project's Architecture
1. Use Knockoutjs View-Model-ViewModel to render in DOM
2. Include at least five locations
3. Use one third party api to get information
4. Application should be responsive
